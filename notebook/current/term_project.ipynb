    "# Term project\n",
    "\n",
    "This course requires you to build a software package of a scientific, mathematic, or numerical application.  Everyone needs to choose a subject individually, and submit the proposal of the term project no later than the end of the day of the 7th week, in a digital form.  You are expected to discuss with the instructor if you are unsure about how to choose as the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software package, of which the source code is publicly available, needs to be hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/).  The software needs to be executable on the [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) on 64-bit x86 through command line.  Building the software package should use a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone needs to present the project to the class at the end of the course.  The project is graded based on the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good engineering infrastructure.\n",
    "* Correct implementation and solution to the problem.\n",
    "* Adequate architecture.\n",
    "* Good presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any lawful subject is OK.\n",

    "## Presentation guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "Each presentation can use at most 25 minutes.  It is suggested that the presentation itself uses about 20 minutes.  The 5 minutes are left for questions and discussions.  But presenters may decide how to use their time.  Presenters are expect to prepare computers for presentation.  The time for setting up the computer is included in the allotted presentation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If presenters have difficulty in preparing a computer themselves, they may seek help from the instructor, and resolve the issue one week before their presentation.\n",
